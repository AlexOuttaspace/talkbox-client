should do client.resetStore() on logout so that every private data inside apollo cache is destroyed.

storing tokens in apollo cache is a bad idea, because it makes managing them way harder. Like when user tries to access a private route with bad tokens, we can erase them from headers by setting a 'Set-Cookie' header, but how are we gonna remove those tokens from apollo cache? 

if we store tokens only within cookies, refreshing tokens functionality will stil work because when server fails to decode access token, he will use refresh token. However we need to work on a case when refresh token is invalid as well.
